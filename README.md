# HIV-Inhibitor-Detector

This project predicts whether a molecule is a potential HIV inhibitor or not using a Graph Attention Network (GAT). The dataset used is the HIV dataset from the MoleculeNet website, which includes molecular structures, their activities, and binary labels indicating their HIV inhibition activity. The model achieved an accuracy of 92%, demonstrating its efficacy in classifying molecules for HIV inhibition.

Tech Stack: Python, RDKit, Pytorch, DeepChem.
